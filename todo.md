### short-term
- defintely can trigger a re-render/javascript potentially
- make a whole special tab for column settings: color, column width, checkbox control
- error checking: no duplicate names, no bibtex errors, adding when you mean to edit etc etc
- when you directly go to add, it should be blank
- similarly, dont let you add a new reference when you are coming from the Edit page
- move your work out of the github development folder
- a way to delete a whole column, this probably needs to happen on the table settings page
- tons of validation / "are you sure you want to xx"
- on the fly text box generation etc for the add/edit page
- datatable refresh button
- better messaging - both in console and via modals (e.g. ref successfully added would be non intrusive, any error modal would be pretty annoying)
- a 'clear box' button for the add/edit page
- all the cool specific entry columns for everything, instead of textarea entry

### long-term
* exporting lib to endnote format
* use the Button extension to create something you can export to Excel
* writing to a pdf, using the old code
* make a local version of RefManageR in case it goes off CRAN
* calculated fields (e.g., first author, can be calculated from author list)
* button to grab all info from current page (link, full citation (maybe can just "press" and grab bibtex citation from google scholar), and abstract)
