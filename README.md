# Ref manager v1

How to use, eventually

* git clone to a new directory
* have a script that creates the directories that you need (lib etc)
* have a few gifs showing how to use it
** use the google scholar bibtex

This idea is to have this open for the entire time you are working, not to close and re-open etc. so its oke
to have some startup energy required (choosing the right columns etc, resizing etc)

this basically exists to let you scan many many documents and make quick notes 

which is different from the process of really really reading 1 document and understanding it

I argue that this first scanning of the literature and taking notes allows you to find what you are looking for faster

and you don't waste as much time doing a deep dive on something you don't need as much

## requirements
- you need mixtex [https://miktex.org/download]

## to do
- make a whole special tab for column settings
-- color
-- column width
-- checkbox control

- error checking
-- no duplicate names
-- no bibtex errors
-- adding when you mean to edit etc etc

## distant to do
- also use the Button extension to create something you can export to Excel
- all the cool specific entry columns for everything, instead of textarea entry
- writing to a pdf, using the old code
- make a local version of RefManageR in case it goes off CRAN
- git pull, rscript standalone etc etc
