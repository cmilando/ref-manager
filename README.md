# Ref manager v1

How to use, eventually

* git clone to a new directory
* have a script that creates the directories that you need (lib etc)
* have a few gifs showing how to use it
** use the google scholar bibtex

this basically exists to let you scan many many documents and make quick notes 

which is different from the process of really really reading 1 document and understanding it

I argue that this first scanning of the literature and taking notes allows you to find what you are looking for faster

and you don't waste as much time doing a deep dive on something you don't need as much

## requirements
